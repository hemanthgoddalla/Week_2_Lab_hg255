## Dataset name
Student registrations dataset (student_registrations.csv)

## Where it lives in this repo
`data/student_registrations.csv`

## Source and owner
- Source: Module-provided teaching dataset (ODS Week 2/3 labs)
- Data owner: University teaching team / module staff (course materials)
- Provided to students for educational use

## License / allowed use
- Intended for coursework/lab learning within the module.
- Do not redistribute outside the module unless explicitly permitted by the teaching team.

## Collection method (how data was created)
- Synthetic / educational dataset representing typical student registration and engagement variables.
- Values may include intentionally messy entries to support data quality exercises.

## Data description (what each column means)
- `student_id`: Unique student identifier
- `age`: Student age (years)
- `gender`: Student gender label (may contain inconsistent formats)
- `course`: Course label (may contain inconsistent formats)
- `grade`: Grade/score (expected range 0–100)
- `study_hours`: Weekly study hours (expected non-negative, reasonable upper bound)
- `enrol_date`: Enrolment date as text (expected YYYY-MM-DD)
- `attendance_rate`: Attendance percentage (expected 0–100)
- `assignments_submitted`: Count of assignments submitted (expected non-negative)
- `satisfaction_level`: Satisfaction rating (expected 1–5)

## Known limitations
- Missing values are present in some fields.
- Some rows contain impossible values (e.g., negative values, values above expected ranges).
- Categorical fields contain inconsistent casing/labels (e.g., "ai" vs "AI").
- Dates may be malformed or blank.
- Not a real population dataset, so representativeness may be limited.

## Intended use in this lab
- Demonstrate data quality assessment (missingness, invalid values, consistency checks)
- Document early risks for downstream analysis
